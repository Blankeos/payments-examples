### My remarks

- Good starting point: https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/guides/developer-guide/getting-started
- Pricing: Single-Paymnet, Subscription, Lead magnet, Pay what you want. Very very clear UI for me. tbh
- Pricing model: https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/help/products/pricing-models
- I feel like there are more sensible contorls in product creation which is very nice.
- Another con with lemonsqueezy, just like Creem, you can't add multiple items in checkout
